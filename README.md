# Floating Dictionary
I always want to have a dictionary to have the feature of reciting words with a floating window, which can be always on top of other windows.
Then I can recite words while I am doing other things.
So I made this one.

# MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
The first edition of this dictionary is a MVP (Minimum Viable Product).I want to make it very simple but can prefectly meet my needs.
It has the basic features below:
- A floating window to show the meaning of a word. the floating window can be always on top of other windows. and the words would stay for a while before change to the next word.
- A word list to recite. I choose the Coca20000 as the word list. but I can choose the list start and end index to show.
- The words shown in the floating window can be recited in random order or in order. but it should record the shown words and not show them again until all the words in the list have been shown. the records would be reset after the word list configuration is changed.
